***TrekMe  ---Windows Phone 8 and higher tracking app***  

This is final version 1.4.6.2 as released on Windows Phone Store (available only for Windows Phone 10 devices).  

You can sideload here released xap on Windows Phone 8 and 8.1 devices, if you're still in possesion of one :)  

The is no more Microsoft store for Windows 8 and 8.1 devices, please check some threads like this one guide to sideload on Windows Phone 8.1:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41239377/install-xap-file-locally-in-windows-phone-8-1-device

The point is that you need SDK and registered account to be able to sideload. On some older Windows Phone 8 devices it may be possible just to copy the XAP file locally and install.

Known issues:
At start, first couple of lines may show inaccurate location (several red lines drawn on the map missing the target by few hundred meters). Accordingly, speed and distance may be inaccurate. This happens when app is started indoors, so no good GPS signal exists.

So, to have accurate reading start app only when you are outdoors!
