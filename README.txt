Change log since v1.0.0:
	- this is first stable version, tested and working on Samsung Ativ S
	
Known issues:
At start, first couple of lines may show inaccurate location (several red lines drawn on the map missing the target by few hundred meters). Accordingly, speed and distance may be inaccurate. This happens when app is started indoors, so no good GPS signal exists.

Prerequisities:
To be able to load XAP file to your phone, it must be developer unlocked. Please search microsoft:

to register for developer account (it's free).
I will put this app to the Windows Phone Store soon, so then it won't be needed anymore.
